Changelog for Redmine DMSF
==========================

<<<<<<< HEAD
1.5.0: *NOT YET RELEASED*
-----------------------
* Refactored: Old codebase refactored to better enable testability
* New: Hooks are being introduced into Redmines models to react to project data changes where appropriate.
* New: Model structures and inheritence changed to utilise nested set approach.
* New: Locking model re-worked to provide same functionality with less overhead
* New: Permission model introduced
  - Permissions can be assigned to roles used within project, as well as directly to users. 
  - User assigned permissions hold more weight than role based permissions
  - Generally an Allow will beat a Prevent, if you are in 2 groups one of which is prevented from access,
  and one that is permitted - you will still gain access on account of your permit action.
  - Permissions are inherited (when set on a parent folder, will propogate to each item within)
  - Provided Permissions include: READ, WRITE, MODIFY, DELETE, PERMISSIONS
  - The default stance where no permissions exist is a general Allow.
* New: Dmsf::Audit introduced, providing sql-based logging for Dmsf application
* New: Library extension to provide quick permission check (Dmsf::Acl)
* New: Modular Webdav approach:
   - Settings for dmsf will allow strategies to be picked (need to be registered)
   - Webdav will load that particular module for its mounting instruction (or alternative)
   - Defined will be Webdav::None (No Webdav), Webdav::Dmsf (R/W Webdav),
   Webdav::Dmsf::Locked (Read only webdav)
   - There are plans to allow modules to hold their own configuration
* Updated: DmsfFileRevisionAccesses removed in favour of Dmsf::Audit
* Updated: Some Dmsf permissions of the past have been removed (in favour of permissions)
* TODO: Workflow models and libraries for providing better workflows
* TODO: (General) re-write controllers
* TODO: Re-work entire UI to provide richer experience.
